In this tutorial I will show you how to pull data from an API, [BreweryDB](http://www.brewerydb.com/) in this case, and then save that data to a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) database.

We will be using the [brewery_db](https://github.com/tylerhunt/brewery_db) and [firebase](https://github.com/oscardelben/firebase-ruby) gems in this tutorial.
